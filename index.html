                Hoya is a tropical plant, so it enjoys humidity. Use a
                humidifier if you can.
              </p>

              <p>
                Only water Hoya when at least 1 inch of the top soil is dry.
                Keep going until water drains from the bottom, then stop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hoya enjoys light, but never the direct sun. Place it in a
                bright room, but not in direct sun.

                Water when half the soil is dry. It can tolerate less frequent
                watering. However when you water, make sure to completely soak
                the soil.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pothos enjoys light as long as it is indirect, but can easily
                live in darker environment. However, it might grow slower.

                Monstera needs a well-draining and light soil to stay healthy.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is very sensitive to both overwatering and underwatering.
                Water if half of soil is dry, but don't keep it thirsty.
                Depending on the soil, the frequency might differ.
              </p>
              <p>
                Monstera likes bright, well-lit rooms. A place near the window
                but away from direct sun is a perfect place for it.

                Moses-in-cradle is quite resistent, so its very easy to grow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Water if 1 inch of top soil is dry. It can tolerate some

              </p>
              <p>
                It loves brightly-lit rooms. Put it near the window but in
                partial shade. It can live in darker rooms, but the stems will
                become leggy and it will lose its gorgeous purple color.

                To water, Wait until the soil in the pot dries out and then

              </p>
              <p>
                Schefflera likes some shade, so place it in a bright room away
                from windows. but darker rooms will lead to leggy stems.

              <p>
                It likes wet soil, so water a little before soil completely
                dries. A well-draining soil can help avoid soggy soil.
              </p>
              <p>
                As long as the weather is warm, Polka dot can sit next to the
                window in indirect light. purple varieties lose their color in
                darker places.
